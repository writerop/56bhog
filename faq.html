            <summary>Would recipes work if I use my ingredients instead of the ones in the recipe?</summary>
            <p class="text">The recipes provided have only been made with the ingredients listed. However, there may be a lot of different ingredients that you can substitute in, and it will work just as well. But without trying it that way ourselves there is no way we could be sure. We recommend that you try the recipe first as written and then next time you can try adding your own twist.</p>

            <summary>Is there a way to print out your recipes?</summary>
            <p class="text">Currently, we have not provided with a separate feature to print out our recipes. But the browser you are using allows you to print the webpage you are visiting. You can use that too.</p>

            <summary>I tried making one of your recipes and it didn't turn out over well. What can I do next time to get it to turn out right?</summary>
            <p class="text">Since we weren't there when you tried making it, it is very difficult to pinpoint the exact thing that went wrong. Having said that, if a recipe doesn't turn out the first time, there are a few things you can do next time:<br><br>1. Re-read the list of ingredients, the amount for each, and the directions to make sure you haven't skipped anything.<br><br>2. Make sure that you made no substitutions on the first try.<br><br>3. Look up the post again and read the comments and any tips involving that recipe.<br><br>4. If you still haven't uncovered what went wrong, please leave a comment for us directly on our contact us page with the recipe name. We will try and figure out.</p>
